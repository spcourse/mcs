# Exam Programming for Minor Computational Science

Date: October 24 2023

This is a digital exam. The exam consists of 3 assignment in which you have to write a short python program.

You're only evaluated based on the _correctness_ of your solutions, code design is not important. So, you don't have to worry about comments or the style guide.

You can test your code using checkpy. First download the tests for the exam:

    checkpy -d /spcourse/exam-tests

Run checkpy:

    checkpy mcs_exam1


# Rules

- Create one file for all your solutions called `mcs_exam1.py`. This is the file you'll hand in at the end of your exam.
- You're only allowed to use `pandas` package. You're not allowed any other external Python package.
- You're only allowed to use the websites mcs.mprog.nl and the Pandas documentation from https://pandas.pydata.org/. You're not allowed to use any other website. (So also no Google!)
- You are allowed to look at your own code that you wrote during the course.
- You cannot get any help with programming during the exam.
- Submit your solutions when you're done. **Check with the teacher present if you handed in your assignment correctly before leaving the exam venue.**

### Hints

The following steps should help you find solutions to the exercises:

1. Get an overview of the problem at hand:
  - What is the input? I.e., what external information does the function need?
  - What information is set? You might want to pre-define some values that will never change
  - What is the output? What should the function return?
2. Think of two examples, and predict what the output of the program should be given these examples. Determine how you would come to these answers
3. Propose a procedure in pseudocode, and try to find elements you will need to further work out
4. Implement your program in Python, include code that can be used to test your program
5. Test your program extensively using the examples you thought of in step 2, and see if you can find any edge cases where the program gives an unexpected output.
6. Finish your program and submit your solutions. *Before you leave the exam room, check with the proctor that your submission was correctly submitted!*
