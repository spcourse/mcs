# Peer review last assignment

**This part is optional, but highly recommended.** Do this peer review **in person**. Please find a partner in this course with whom to discuss your code for the last assignment. Please find a partner for this review. The intention is not to get or provide written feedback, but to discuss in person.

### Instructions

* Find a partner.
* Take 10 minutes to read each other's code.
* Discuss the differences between your solutions.
* For both solutions discuss what could be improved. **Don't change the code** while discussing.
* Once you've discussed your code take some time (max half an hour) together to create an improved version of the program. Think about which parts of the feedback you want to focus on to improve your code. Not all feedback is always correct and not all of it can always be easily implemented.

### Focus points

Here are some points to focus on when reviewing the code:

* While reading the code, try look for ways to improve it. Ask yourself the following questions:
    * How easy is it to read the code? Are there particular parts that are easy or hard to understand?
        * Could the code or parts of it made easier to read by adding comments?
        * Could the code or parts of it made easier to read by using different variable names?
        * Could the code or parts of it made easier to read by changing the structure?
        * Are there parts of the code that could be made more readable by using functions?
    * How well designed is the code?
        * Are there parts of the code that could be made simpler?
        * Are there loops of if-statements that could be avoided?
        * Are there duplications (copies of identical code) that can be avoided? Can you avoid them using loops or functions?
    * Giving good feedback and understanding how code can be improved is very hard. Don't try to do a perfect job, but focus on what you know.
* Your feedback doesn't have to be in the form of critique. You can also ask questions.
* Also try to point out parts that you think are good.
