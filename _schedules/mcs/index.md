# Programming for minor Computational Science
**2024/2025**

## General info {#general}

Welcome to Programming for minor Computational Science! In the weeks ahead, you’ll use the Python programming language while learning to solve scientific problems from several fields of science. You will learn a lot about the Python language by working on programming problems from several scientific areas. The three courses from this track are designed to be taken together, but you can choose to only follow one or two of the courses.

### Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Programming for minor Computational Science assumes no prior programming experience. If you have already done a course in Python, or if you have extensive experience in another programming language, this course might not be your best option—but we’re happy to refer you to other courses if you’d like!

Other than that, some modules assume high school mathematics or physics, but in those case you can choose an alternative module that doesn't. If you feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to contact the course staff!

### Learning goals {#goals}

Programming for minor Computational Science is a beginner's course. We will teach you the basics of Python programming as well as several different ways of solving computational problems. After this course, we envision that you:

- can transform the description of a simple algorithm into working code by combining basic program elements
- can apply several scientific programming techniques from different areas of study
- can use a couple of libraries in your program and know how to find and read documentation on other libraries
- can make your programs simpler and easier to read by employing a few standard tactics
- can trace and fix several common programming errors
- can use native python data structures (like sets, dictionaries, and tuples)
- analyze the complexity of an algorithm
- quickly learn to use new python packages and know how to find documentation for them
- import and analyze data
- create advanced plots

### Course materials {#materials}

All the reading and video material is available on this website. You do not need to purchase any books or software. Every module consists of short explanations (written and in the form of videos) and assignments. _You do need to bring your own laptop._

### Staff {#staff}

Amir Sahrani, Coen van den Elsen, Loes Bijman, Steph Drake, Simon Pauw

### Getting started {#start}

Your entry to the course is the sidebar, where you can leaf through all modules (levels) that you have to complete. To get started:

- Read the rest of the syllabus, below.
- Install Python.
- Choose one of the level 1 modules (Algorithms or Numbers) to get started!

### Structure {#structure}

You can find the tutorial schedule here: [datanose](https://datanose.nl/#course[129494]). The course consist of two type of tutorials:

- Plenary tutorials: On Tuesday's there are tutorial sessions.
  - These tutorials are intended for discussing the theory.
  - Theses tutorials take place in room G4.15
- Individual tutorials: During the sessions on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, you can het help with your programming assignments. You’ll work on campus (together with other students) in a classroom. You can ask us questions while you’re working on your assignments.
  - We don't expect you to come to all tutorials, but **we highly recommend to join at least one tutorial a week.**
  - These tutorials all take place in the proglab rooms: L0.09 / L0.10
  - This is a good place to work on your assignments and get immediate help.
  - This is the main place where you can meet other students.

### Programming modules {#programming-modules}

You're going to learn programming through a number of programming modules (called levels). Each module consist of:

- Theory: Explanations both written and in the form of video's.
- Practice: Exercises to test your understanding of the theory.
- Assignments: Bigger programming problems, that require combining multiple programming concepts.

Here below is an overview of all modules for all courses.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td> Level 0 </td><td colspan="3"> Python Installation </td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>
      <b>Level 1</b>
    </td><td colspan="3">
      <b>ALGORITHMS</b>. Learn to think like a computer. Things that we intuitively know how to do, like drawing a pyramid or computing change for a payment, is hard to get a computer to do right. In this module you’ll learn how to break down such intuitive problems into steps that even a computer can understand.
    </td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>
      <b>Level 2</b>
    </td><td colspan="3">
      <b>NUMERICAL INTEGRATION</b>. In many scientific fields you need to determine the surface area under a function. Integration is a mathematical tool for doing so. However this tool doesn't always work and in such cases we can use numerical integration techniques to let the computer do the work for us. You will learn two important techniques for numerical integration.
    </td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td> <b>Level 3</b></td><td colspan="3"> <b>BIG-DATA</b>. In this module you will learn to work with data. You will, for example, analyze weather from the Netherlands and answer questions like: When was the first heat-wave? What was the longest freezing period? </td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td> <b>Level 4</b> </td><td colspan="3"> <b>MONOPOLY</b>. When playing Monopoly, a starting player's advantage seems unfair. To verify, you could play many (millions) real games, but this would take way too much time. Instead, you'll write a computer simulation. This also allows you to experiment with game adjustments to make it fair. You're doing all this for a board game, but this simulation principle applies to various scientific fields (economy, chemistry, biology...).</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td> <b>Level 5</b> </td><td colspan="3"> <b>COMPLEXITY</b>. What is an efficient algorithm? When you want to run large simulations, analyze large dataset, or any other computationally intensive task, writing efficient algorithms could in some cases mean the difference between a run time of a couple of minutes or of weeks. The theory of computational complexity gives you a way to reason about the efficiency of algorithms and make them run (much) faster.</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td> <b>Level 6</b> </td><td colspan="3"> <b>SURVIVAL</b>. Python is very popular for analyzing and processing data. And Pandas is an important reason why. Pandas is the most used Python package for handling data. You will learn how to use this package to analyze and visualize geographical data.</td>

## Grading {#grading}

TLDR; In order to pass the course you need to:

- pass level 1 and 2
- have an average 5.5 or higher for levels 3 to 6
- pass the final exam

Details:

* For levels 1 and 2 you do not get a grade. Instead you will get a pass or fail. If you get a fail for the module you will be able to resubmit it. You need to have a pass for both modules in order to pass the course.
* For levels 3 to 6 you get a grade based on the code quality (how well written is the code?) and the correctness (does it meet the specifications?) of your assignment. Both are graded on a scale from 1 to 5. Where the correctness weighs more than code quality: $$\textrm{points} = \textrm{correctness} \times 3 + \textrm{design} \times 2$$. So you can get at most 25 and at least 5 points. The points are coverted to grade between 1 and 10 ($$\textrm{grade} = 1 + 9 \times (\textrm{points} - 5.0) / 20$$). You need to get at least a 5.5 average for these modules to pass the course.
* The final exam will consist of a number of small programming assignment that you will make on your own laptop in a controlled environment. The exam is pass/fail. You need to pass the exam in order to pass the course.
* So, the grade is determined only by level 3 to 6, but you need to make everything sufficiently correct to pass the course.

## Doing your own work {#plagiarism}

This course's philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as "be reasonable." The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course's material. However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. This policy characterizes both sides of that line.

The essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own (unless explicitly stated otherwise). Collaboration on problem sets is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you. Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your code to others, but you may not view theirs, so long as you and they respect this policy's other constraints. Collaboration on the course's test and quiz is not permitted at all.

Below are rules of thumb that (inexhaustively) characterize acts that the course considers reasonable and not reasonable. If in doubt as to whether some act is reasonable, do not commit it until you solicit and receive approval in writing from the course's heads. Acts considered not reasonable by the course are handled harshly.

### Reasonable

- Communicating with classmates about problem sets' problems in English (or some other spoken language).
- Discussing the course's material with others in order to understand it better.
- Helping a classmate identify a bug in his or her code at office hours, elsewhere, or even online, as by viewing, compiling, or running his or her code, even on your own computer.
- Incorporating a few lines of code that you find online or elsewhere into your own code, provided that those lines are not themselves solutions to assigned problems and that you cite the lines' origins.
- Reviewing past semesters' quizzes and solutions thereto.
- Sending or showing code that you've written to someone, possibly a classmate, so that he or she might help you identify and fix a bug.
- Sharing a few lines of your own code online so that others might help you identify and fix a bug.
- Turning to the course's heads for help or receiving help from the course's heads during the quiz or test.
- Turning to the web or elsewhere for instruction beyond the course's own, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not for outright solutions to problem set's problems or your own final project.
- Whiteboarding solutions to problem sets with others using diagrams or pseudocode but not actual code.
- Working with (and even paying) a tutor to help you with the course, provided the tutor does not do your work for you.

### Not Reasonable

- Accessing a solution to some problem prior to (re-)submitting your own.
- Asking a classmate to see his or her solution to a problem set's problem before (re-)submitting your own.
- Decompiling, de-obfuscating, or disassembling the staff's solutions to problem sets.
- Failing to cite (as with comments) the origins of code or techniques that you discover outside of the course's own lessons and integrate into your own work, even while respecting this policy's other constraints.
- Giving or showing to a classmate a solution to a problem set's problem when it is he or she, and not you, who is struggling to solve it.
- Looking at another individual's work during the test or quiz.
- Paying or offering to pay an individual for work that you may submit as (part of) your own.
- Providing or making available solutions to problem sets to individuals who might take this course in the future.
- Searching for or soliciting outright solutions to problem sets online or elsewhere. So, **avoid** sources like: **Stackoverflow, Google, chatGPT, GitHub, Copilot**, etc.
- Splitting a problem set's workload with another individual and combining your work.
- Submitting (after possibly modifying) the work of another individual beyond the few lines allowed herein.
- Submitting the same or similar work to this course that you have submitted or will submit to another.
- Submitting work to this course that you intend to use outside of the course (e.g., for a job) without prior approval from the course's heads.
- Turning to humans (besides the course's heads) for help or receiving help from humans (besides the course's heads) during the quiz or test.
- Viewing another's solution to a problem set's problem and basing your own solution on it.
